# SheepMyBoat application's protocol

## 1 - Overview
The SheepMyBoat protocol is meant to play a battleship game over the network. It's a client-server protocol.   
The client connects to a server and request to play a new game if another player is also ready to play.    
The server manage the game's logic between the two players.   

## 2 - Transport protocol
The SheepMyBoat protocol uses the `TCP protocol`. The server runs on the `port 11111`.  
The client has to know the IP address of the server to connect to. **The client establishes the connection with the server.**   
The connection ends when a game is over. If you want to replay or play with another player you will have to reconnect.
